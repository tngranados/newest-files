## Finding Reference Files with `newest-files`

### Why This Matters
In large, long-lived codebases, patterns evolve. Older files may contain legacy approaches we no longer want to replicate. **Always prefer learning from the newest files** in a category—they reflect current best practices, recent refactors, and the team's latest conventions.

### The Tool
`newest-files` lists the N most-recently-created files in a Git repository, ordered by the commit date when each file was first added. This is NOT modification date—it's true creation date from Git history.

**Syntax:**
```bash
newest-files [options] [GLOB]
```

**Options:**
- `-n, --count NUMBER` — Number of files to show (default: 10)
- `GLOB` — Filter by glob pattern (e.g., `"*.rb"`, `"app/services/**/*.rb"`)

### When to Use It
Use `newest-files` **before writing new code** to find exemplary files to study:

| Task              | Command                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| New Ruby file     | `newest-files -n 5 "**/*.rb"`                 |
| New lib file      | `newest-files -n 5 "lib/**/*.rb"`             |
| New test file     | `newest-files -n 5 "test/**/*_test.rb"`       |
| New spec file     | `newest-files -n 5 "spec/**/*_spec.rb"`       |
| New model         | `newest-files -n 5 "app/models/**/*.rb"`      |
| New service       | `newest-files -n 5 "app/services/**/*.rb"`    |
| New controller    | `newest-files -n 5 "app/controllers/**/*.rb"` |
| New configuration | `newest-files -n 5 "config/**/*.rb"`          |

### Workflow
1. **Identify the category** of file you need to create (service, model, test, etc.)
2. **Run `newest-files`** with the appropriate glob to get 3-5 recent examples
3. **Read those files** to understand current patterns, naming conventions, and structure
4. **Also check `.templates/`** for the canonical template (templates + recent examples = best guidance)
5. **Write your new code** following the patterns you observed

### Example
Finding the newest library files to understand current patterns:
```bash
$ newest-files -n 3 "lib/**/*.rb"
Created          │ Author              │ File                                    │ Commit
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2025-11-24 17:22 │ Toni Granados       │ lib/newest_files/formatter.rb           │ 1ced2b31
2025-11-24 15:56 │ Toni Granados       │ lib/newest_files/finder.rb              │ e28a25f1
2025-11-24 14:50 │ Toni Granados       │ lib/newest_files/cli.rb                 │ 386904e1
```
Then read those 3 files to see how the library is currently structured before writing your own.

### Key Benefits
- **Avoids mimicking legacy code** — Old files may have outdated patterns, deprecated methods, or pre-refactor structures
- **Learns from recent decisions** — Recent files incorporate lessons learned and current team conventions
- **Consistent codebase** — New code matches recent code, not code from years ago
